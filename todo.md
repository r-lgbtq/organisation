# A to-do/wishlist for rainbowR

- [ ] Write pinned post for Mastodon

- [x] Edit sign-up sheet: 
	- [x] remove Twitter, add Fediverse
	- [x] substitute 'birth sex' with 'gender assigned at birth'

- [ ] Organise a speaker series. 
  - Ella has list (not for public repo) of possible speakers

- [ ] Website updates:
	- [ ] Add events page
	- [ ] Add contact details, add tech.lgbt, remove twitter
	- [ ] Template for blog posts
	- [ ] Light and dark modes

- [ ] GitHub home page, including CoC
- [ ] Elicit posts for blog (once there's a template and workflow for that)
- [ ] Relaunch TidyRainbow
- [ ] Can we have a meetup page? If so, under what organisation?
- [ ] Partnerships with other communities - Rladies, MiR, AI-inclusive, Queer in AI
- [ ] Think about forming a committee
    - what roles?
    - how to recruit?
- [x] Add an organisation repo and create an issue template for organising/promoting meet-ups (see [https://github.com/WarwickRUG/organization](https://github.com/WarwickRUG/organization))
- [ ] Update visual identity?

- [ ] Organise a mini-conference
	- Take inspiration from DSxD conference, as well as <https://www.hytradboi.com> - two very different approaches.
- [ ] Organise a hackathon (think about a suitable project for one)
	- Perhaps tie in with TidyRainbow 
- [ ] Do something to revitalise the Slack, perhaps a discusion group?
- [ ] Do more with Mastodon - make sure people turn on notifications for the account
- [ ] Newsletter
  - [x] email notices about meetups
  - [x] set up {blastula}
  - [ ] further automate the process with {googlesheets4}
- [ ] Promote the work of RainbowR members
  	- Ad hoc or something more structured?
- [ ] Support sessions
- [ ] Reading group (if suitable book found)
- [ ] Move this to-do list to a series of GitHub issues
- [ ] rainbowR buddy program
- [ ] rainbowR mentor program
	- Basic idea: get people who want to be mentored (with something specific), people willing to be mentors (with specific things they're willing to mentor on) and pair up suitable pairs.
   	- Inspired by rOpenSci Champions programme (though would be much smaller and looser)
   	- Speak to Yani about how this might work.
- [ ] rainbowR tie-in and/or event at useR::2024?
- [ ] Co-working sessions, taking inspiration from rOpenSci
