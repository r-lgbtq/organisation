# A to-do/wishlist for RainbowR

- Organise a speaker series. 
  - Ella has list (not for public repo) of possible speakers

- Website updates:
	- Add events page
	- Add contact details, add tech.lgbt, remove twitter
	- Template for blog posts

- Elicit posts for blog (once there's a template and workflow for that)
- Relaunch TidyRainbow
- Can we have a meetup page? If so, under what organisation?
- Partnerships with other communities - Rladies, MIR
- Think about forming a committee
- Add an organisation repo and create an issue template for organising/promoting meet-ups (see [https://github.com/WarwickRUG/organization](https://github.com/WarwickRUG/organization))
- Update visual identity?
